Adris Jautakas, Jawadul Kadir, and Khyber Sen

CAstro Party - This project intends to be a recreation of the popular mobile game
Astro Party written in C, using SDL 2.0. The project will feature multiplayer
gameplay and lobby hosting for multiple games at once with up to four players per
lobby.

The user will interact with the program through the GUI provided by SDL and using
keyboard buttons to move the character in the game.

Topics covered in class used:
Allocating memory for dynamic structures in the game, such as players and bullets.
Forking from main server into multiple lobbies and from lobbies to helper processes
that deal with networking and receiving input.
Signals to regulate interactions between all the processes.
Using pipes to communicate between the main server and lobbies
Using shared memory to keep track of inputs, which is written by the networking
process and read by the game process.
Networking to allow for remote multiplayer
