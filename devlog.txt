Added a bunch of my utility code from past projects under src/util/.
    string_utils.h contains a bunch of useful string functions.
    stacktrace.h can set a signal handler that prints a stacktrace on any signal, including SIGSEGV.
    utils.h has a bunch of useful error message and debug macros.
    The other files have some other things that might be useful later.
Added sdl_utils.h, which contains useful error message and debug macros for SDL errors.
Added sdl_colors.h, which has named color constants.
Fixed some of the code in vector.h and wrote as much of it with macros,
    so that the vector doesn't have to be copied on each function call.
    The ones that I couldn't macro-ize, I inlined.
Rewrote most of the main.c code in game.h using a Game struct that contains all the data for a single game.
    Game_init() is a pseudo-constructor that initializes the SDL stuff and allocates memory for other fields,
        and it handles errors well, propagating -1 returns and printout out error messages and line numbers.
    Game_destroy() destroys and frees all the SDL and other allocated memory,
        and sets all the fields to 0 or NULL or the appropriate base value.
    Game_add_player() just adds a new players to the game through the Players *players field (see below).
    Game_run() starts and runs the core game loop.
        On every frame, it checks to see if Game.interrupt, a function pointer, has been set.
        If it has, then it is called.
        This allows another thread to interrupt the game in anyway it desires,
        such as setting Game.is_running = false to pause the game
        or setting Game.quit = true to quit the game.
        It always calls Game_loop().
    Game_loop() runs the each core game loop.
        It fetches the current time/tick using SDL_GetPerformanceCounter()
        and computes the delta_time compared to the Game.prev_time
        in seconds, using SDL_GetPerformanceFrequency().
        This delta_time is used to call Game_update(),
        and then Game_render() is called.
        (V-Sync takes care of ensuring that FPS doesn't go higher than necessary).
        Game.prev_time is always updated, even if Game.is_running is false.
    Game_update() updates the entire tree of game objects according to a delta_time.
        Right now, the tree of game objects only consists of the players in Game.players,
        but it will later include everything else as well, such as bullets and obstacles.
    Game_render() renders every game object given an SDL_Renderer.
        This is called after Game_update() has been called for each game object.
        Before calling rendering the game objects, Game_renders() clears the screen with black,
        and after rendering the game objects, it calls SDL_RenderPresent() to actually render everything.
Wrote the Players struct in players.h.
    Players keeps track of a dynamic array of players, with a maximum number of players set (a uint8_t).
    It has functions to add players (Players_add()),
    update them (Players_update()), and render them (Players_render()).
    The latter two just call Player_update() and Player_render(), respectively, on each Player in the array.
Created mostly empty files for Bullet, Obstacle, Bullets, and Obstacles,
    which will have a similar relationship as Player and Players.

Added a Game_hash() method that hashes all the game objects and other fields.
    This can be used to communicate between server and client and
    ensure that both game simulations are accurate, i.e. they have the same hash.
    By using a hash, everything doesn't have to be compared, just a long sent over network to verify.
    A client could potentially try to do something illegal, and this will allow the server to verify
    that the server and client game simulations are synced.
    The hashing uses 64-bit hash methods in hash.h,
    such as FNV-1a for strings and
    a weird method I came up multiply the hash as a double with the previous hash
    and reinterpreting it as a uint64_t again.
Typedef'd the Game.interruptor field to GameInterruptor and created default GameInterruptors.
    By setting the volatile Game.interruptor field,
    the function will be safely called to modify the game in the game thread.
    This can pause the game (GameInterruptor_pause()) or quit the game (GameInterruptor_quit())
    and potentially anything else.
    Game_pause() and Game_quit() just set these interruptors for the game.
Game_new() allocated and initializes a new Game with default values using Game_init().
Create a Sprite struct
    that contains an SDL_Texture*,
    the width and height of the texture,
    and the GameTexture enum as a unique id.
Created a lazy, caching mechanism for loading SDL_Textures and their corresponding Sprites.
    get_sprite() returns a Sprite* into a static array according to a GameTexture.
        If the Sprite for that GameTexture has already been loaded, it's returned.
        Otherwise, the SDL_Texture* is loaded and the new Sprite created and returned.
    get_texture() does the same, just using the SDL_Texture* texture field in Sprite.
    get_sprite() and get_texture() both take a SDL_Renderer*,
        because it's necessary for IMG_LoadTexture(), which actually loads the SDL_Texture*.
    The GameTexture enum is mapped to a static array of filenames in the src/textures/ directory,
        such that each GameTexture corresponds to a texture file in src/textures/,
        which is loaded into the Sprite[].

Updated DESIGN.txt with a better explanation of the game and more data structures and algorithms.

Got everything to compile correctly and start running,
    but on my Windows laptop w/ Cygwin,
    SDL_Init() fails because SDL_GetNumVideoDisplays() == 0
    and thus there are no available video devices.

Got the game to actually start and render a static spaceship correctly.
    It only works on my Ubuntu VM right now, not Windows, which is unfortunate, but okay.
Made some changes to Game, GameState, and Player.
    Figured out how to somewhat simulate access modifiers by creating overlapping fields through unions,
        where one version of the field is mutable and the other is const.
Added branchless clamp() and Vector_clamp() functions (macros) in Vector.h
    which ensure a value is between two other values
    without using any branching if statements, but instead the branchless, optimized fmaxf() and fminf().
Added a Game_quit_later() method that quits the game (double) seconds later.
    This is down by spawning a new thread that sleeps for that many seconds and then calls Game_quit().
    Added a double_sleep() function that sleeps for that many seconds specified as a double.
Fixed Player so that its position is the center of the sprite.
    Also added Sprite.center, which is the float center of the size of the sprite.
    This is useful in calculating the SDL_Rect border of the spaceship that should be rendered.
Wrote most of Player_render() so that it render's the spaceship
    with the correct size and position.
    However, the orientation doesn't rotate around the correct center right now,
    even though I set the rotation center as Player.position as an SDL_Point.
